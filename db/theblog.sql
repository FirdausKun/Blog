(44, 'Dips, kebabs and crisp spuds: Olia Hercules’ comfort food recipes', '<p>Home food is comfort food. There is no other place I would rather be, and no other place I would rather eat in. I didn&rsquo;t cook as a child growing up in Ukraine, but I ate very well because my mother, Olga, my father, Petro, and my extended family were so excellent at it. It was only when I left my family and ended up a student in the UK that I was suddenly drawn to cooking. When phone conversations failed to satisfy my longing for comfort, home and love, making my mum&rsquo;s food succeeded. Suddenly, whenever I cooked, those early-wired neurons in my brain fired up very specific feelings: feelings of wellbeing.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Koobideh</em>&nbsp;kebab</strong></p>\r\n<div id=\"sign-in-gate\"></div>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-3jlghf\">I cannot emphasise enough that you need a lot of fat to make a super-juicy kebab, so use the fattiest minced lamb you can find.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-3jlghf\">Prep&nbsp;<strong>10 min<br></strong>Chill&nbsp;<strong>30 min+<br></strong>Cook&nbsp;<strong>30 min<br></strong>Serves&nbsp;<strong>6</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-3jlghf\"><strong>150g onions</strong>, peeled<br><strong>500g&nbsp;</strong><strong>lamb mince</strong>, the fattier, the better<br><strong>2 tsp ground turmeric<br>&frac12; tsp bicarbonate of soda<br>Sea salt and black pepper</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-3jlghf\">To serve<br><strong>Flatbreads</strong><strong><br>Ground sumac</strong>, for sprinkling</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-3jlghf\">Grate the onions into a large bowl on the coarse side of a grater, making sure to catch the juices. Add the mince, turmeric, bicarbonate of soda (it helps the meat to bind together), half a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of ground pepper, and mix. And I mean&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;mix it: get your hands in there and massage and work it. After four minutes of such manipulations, if you have time, cover and chill for 30 minutes (or overnight). This will help it hold together.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-3jlghf\">Get six long, metal skewers and have ready a bowl of warm water to wet your hands, so the meat doesn&rsquo;t stick to them. Divide the meat mix into six equal pieces and, with wet hands, shape each into a sausage with a smooth surface (it&rsquo;s important there are no cracks). Mash the meat around the top of one skewer and work it carefully down its length, so you have an even layer all along the skewer. Keep wetting your hands and rotate the skewer as you squash/distribute the meat around it. There should be no air pockets, and make sure both ends of the kebab are tightly attached to the skewer. Repeat with the remaining meat and skewers. If the meat fails to cooperate, dispose of the skewers and fry the mix as sausages.</p>\r\n<div class=\"ad-slot-container ad-slot--offset-right \">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-3jlghf\">Fire up a barbecue or oven grill (obviously, fire is where the magic is). If using a barbecue, wait until the embers have calmed down; they should be glowing red, but there shouldn&rsquo;t be any flames. Lay the skewers about 20cm away from the heat, then cook, turning regularly, until lightly golden all over and cooked through and juicy inside. (You can always cut into one to check.)</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-3jlghf\">Grab each skewer (with a heat-resistant glove), point its sharp end into a chopping board, then use a flatbread to slide off the kebab. Arrange the kebabs on a pile of flatbreads, so all the juices go into the bread, sprinkle liberally with sumac and serve with a salad or whole grilled tomatoes.</p>', '9616214.jpg', 1, 'Food', '2022-06-30'),
(45, 'Cristiano Ronaldo’s departure will hurt but now Manchester United can move forward', '<p>Ralf Rangnick had been Manchester United manager for two days when he observed to a colleague that he couldn&rsquo;t play with Cristiano Ronaldo, but he certainly couldn&rsquo;t play without him &ndash; and that is the dilemma any manager of United will have.</p>\r\n<p>There remained at times something vaguely glorious about Ronaldo last season. He was still capable of narrative-shifting late goals. He still looked the same, a little slower perhaps, but his body was evidence of a lifetime&rsquo;s dedication. Though much had been lost, much abided; it was still at times possible to believe that some noble work could yet be done.</p>\r\n<p>But the problem was those escapades, those glimmers of what he once was, came against Atalanta, Norwich or Tottenham in one of their bad phases. It was enough, perhaps, to persuade those who wanted to believe, but Ronaldo in his second United coming has been a diminished presence. There&rsquo;s no shame in that: he is 37, way beyond the age at which most forwards have decided the Premier League is no longer for them.</p>\r\n<p>He did score 18 league goals last season, eight more than any of his teammates. At a club that has become increasingly obsessed by nostalgia during a decade-long decline, he is a symbol of a more profitable time (and in his return, perhaps, also a symbol of a less decisive, less successful era). He is a celebrity. As United&rsquo;s marketing people might say, he raises brand awareness.</p>\r\n<p>And so in that sense the news on Saturday that Ronaldo wants to leave came as blow. It made clear that his return, which cost a &pound;20m fee and &pound;500,000 a week in wages, has been a failure. It&rsquo;s easy to portray that as another example of United lurching into chaos. But getting rid of Ronaldo is also probably the most important step in rebuilding United. Erik ten Hag has said that he was keen to work with Ronaldo but we can safely assume he was being diplomatic. If Ronaldo does leave, freeing up the budget and making it easier to impose the new manager&rsquo;s philosophy, it will surely come as a relief.</p>\r\n<p>Ten Hag is a classic Ajax coach; he plays hard-pressing football. Excluding centre-backs, Ronaldo attempted fewer pressures than any other outfield player in Europe&rsquo;s top five leagues last season. Those two details do not &ndash; cannot &ndash; go together. There is a fundamental disconnect that cannot be reconciled. No coach who wants to play modern football can accommodate Ronaldo. Perhaps a more reactive manager like Diego Simeone or a star-whisperer like Carlos Ancelotti could get something out of him (although you suspect Simeone&rsquo;s demand for self-sacrifice would soon create issues) but no pressing coach could.</p>\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not just a matter of style. Ronaldo is so big he dwarfs any club he plays for. Even Manchester United became FC Ronaldo. Everything is sublimated to him. There are numerous stories of him last season disrupting drills on shape because he found them boring, insisting practice should be fun. He clashed with Harry Maguire over the captaincy. When Rangnick left him out for the Manchester derby, he returned to Portugal for treatment on his hip flexor and so, even in his absence, the story became about Ronaldo.</p>\r\n<p>Any club for which he plays develops an unhealthy dependency. He is a brilliant goalscorer, so you play to his strengths so he can score goals. The problem is that ends up undermining the general pattern of play, makes it harder to create the structures that give a team control, and the side becomes predictable. Ronaldo&rsquo;s goalscoring interventions protected United from an even worse campaign last season, but if he hadn&rsquo;t been there they may not have needed them.</p>\r\n<p>Two obvious problems remain. The first is that it&rsquo;s not obvious who will sign Ronaldo now. With the possible exception of Paris Saint-Germain &ndash; who seem oddly enthused by the prospect of creating a waxwork gallery of players who were good in La Liga seven years ago &ndash; no European club who could afford him plays the sort of football that suits Ronaldo. Even his old club Real Madrid, never usually shy of a 30-something star, may think in the light of Karim Benzema&rsquo;s form that they have moved on.</p>', '2903594.webp', 1, 'Sport', '2022-06-30'),
(46, 'Olivia Rodrigo: ‘I’m a teenage girl. I feel heartbreak and longing really intensely’', '<p class=\"dcr-139bh9t\"><span class=\"dcr-139bh9t\">Do you remember your first heartbreak? If not, 18-year-old Olivia Rodrigo&rsquo;s debut single, Drivers License, may awaken some dusty memories. The story of passing her test and driving past the house of the ex she had planned to celebrate with, it filters Adele-scale devastation through Taylor Swift&rsquo;s wit and Lorde&rsquo;s mysticism, balancing hangdog self-pity (&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never felt this way for no one!&rdquo;) with stinging indignation: &ldquo;Guess you didn&rsquo;t mean what you wrote in that song about me!&rdquo; she belts at its climax. Perhaps being called out as a phoney songwriter is even worse than being a cad.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-139bh9t\">Released in January, Drivers License sprang (almost) out of nowhere like a heaved sob. Four days later, it broke Spotify records for the most single-day streams (Christmas songs exempted). The next day, it broke that record again. After 10 weeks at No 1 in the US and nine in the UK, it has been streamed 1.9bn times. Next Tuesday, the California-born songwriter makes her live debut at the Brits; the following weekend, she does Saturday Night Live; a week later she releases her debut album, Sour, a grippingly well written &ndash; all by her &ndash; collection of balladry, pop-punk, bitter diatribes and euphoric taunts that dwells on this romantic treachery. Even in an era when virality powers pop, Rodrigo&rsquo;s is a fast rise.</p>\r\n<div id=\"sign-in-gate\"></div>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-139bh9t\">Quarantine restrictions mean arriving 10 days pre-Brits, so we speak on Wednesday morning, just 24 hours after Rodrigo landed in the UK. She is isolating just outside London. Mild hoarseness aside, she shows no trace of her terrible jet lag and is more alert and composed than any human I&rsquo;ve encountered since March 2020. She supposedly just woke up but her eyeliner is tidy, her skin glowy. This week inside is a chance to nail some homework &ndash; &ldquo;economics and English, all the good stuff like that, and environmental science, ugh, gross&rdquo; &ndash; so she can graduate high school this year. In the first song she ever posted online, I&rsquo;m More, she sang, &ldquo;I care way too much about getting into college&rdquo;, but notions of further studying (psychology, English or history) are on hold.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-139bh9t\">Rodrigo was homeschooled long before the pandemic. She has been a Disney star since 2016, first in Bizaardvark, about two oddball vloggers, then High School Musical: The Musical: The Series (HSM), a mockumentary where the &ldquo;real-life&rdquo; teenagers attending the school where the original movies were filmed stage their own musical of HSM. The stars learn on set; fake Disney high school is as close as they&rsquo;ll get to the real thing. Rodrigo questioned whether her unconventional life would make her songwriting unrelatable. Lorde&rsquo;s debut, Pure Heroine, inspired her to get serious about it at age 12. &ldquo;She talks about driving to the suburbs and going to school and all her friend-group drama,&rdquo; says Rodrigo. &ldquo;I remember feeling so seen: she&rsquo;s taking this normal experience that we all go through and turning it into something really beautiful and artful. I always wanted to write a record like that, but never felt like I had that normal life experience.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-139bh9t\">Then normal life &ndash; that pesky shattered heart &ndash; intruded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting, heartbreaks when you&rsquo;re 16 or 17,&rdquo; says Rodrigo, &ldquo;because you don&rsquo;t yet have that perspective of knowing that life goes on and you&rsquo;re gonna meet other people; that it wasn&rsquo;t the only happy experience you&rsquo;ll ever have.&rdquo; She recounts a day on set where the cast was filming &ldquo;a really poppy, happy dance number&rdquo;. Between takes, she was squirrelled away with her acoustic guitar, writing &ldquo;this sad-ass song&rdquo; called Happier, wishing her ex well and admiring his new girlfriend. On the piano-led album version, the verses spill over beautifully; the chorus awkwardly, earnestly strains its crescendo, showing the effort of her beneficence.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-139bh9t\">Much analysis of Drivers License&rsquo;s wild success concerned a rumoured relationship between Rodrigo and a male co-star (and the alleged third wheel), which you can read about in asinine detail elsewhere. There is no way the majority of listeners cared about this; the song&rsquo;s appeal is its musical familiarity and the cinematic lyrics laying out Rodrigo&rsquo;s eviscerated-but-still-beating heart. (Even her best friend, Bizaardvark co-star Madison Hu &ndash; who steered Rodrigo through the breakup in real time &ndash; said she only really understood her anguish when she heard it.) And for all the media obsession with gen-Z culture shifts, she is reassuringly traditional: the eternal lovelorn teenage songwriter. Rodrigo&rsquo;s songwriting also subtly distills the passing of innocence. Her second single, the gleefully accusatory Deja Vu, ribbed her ex for repeating their rituals with his new girl (Billy Joel songs, Glee) but also acknowledged &ldquo;everything is all reused&rdquo;. Losing first love, she says, &ldquo;feels sort of earth-shattering in a way that&rsquo;s obviously heartbreaking but really beautiful, too&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-139bh9t\">When Rodrigo meets someone new, she always asks if they have any ghost stories: Sour is its own collection of them, I suggest. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m literally obsessed with that!&rdquo; she says effusively. (She is, enjoyably, &ldquo;literally obsessed&rdquo; with many things during our conversation, including Dua Lipa &ndash; whom she wants to meet at the Brits &ndash; Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder and the recording studio.) &ldquo;I never thought about that but I&rsquo;m going to use that now! Yeah, I feel like that period of my life is sort of over now, like&nbsp;<em>dead</em>,&rdquo; she says with relish. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun to look back on those memories and know that they&rsquo;re not real and happening right now, but you still experienced them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-139bh9t\">Was the obsession with the supposed relationship drama sexist? She sighs. &ldquo;I try not to look at it or take that stuff super seriously.&rdquo; But she has noticed &ldquo;sexist criticism of songwriters like me being told that they only write songs about boys&rdquo;. She watched it happen with Swift, her favourite songwriter, &ldquo;which is just BS in my mind&rdquo;. She has never understood the argument. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a teenage girl, I write about stuff that I feel really intensely &ndash; and I feel heartbreak and longing really intensely &ndash; and I think that&rsquo;s authentic and natural. I don&rsquo;t really understand what people want me to write about; do you want me to write a song about income taxes? How am I going to write an emotional song about that?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<div class=\"ad-slot-container ad-slot--offset-right \">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"ad-slot-container ad-slot--offset-right \">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-139bh9t\">Sour feels &ldquo;intrinsically young&rdquo;, she says; the point was to honour those acute teenage feelings. &ldquo;Something I&rsquo;m really proud of is that this record talks about emotions that are hard to talk about or aren&rsquo;t really socially acceptable especially for girls: anger, jealousy, spite, sadness, they&rsquo;re frowned-upon as bitchy and moaning and complaining or whatever. But I think they&rsquo;re such valid emotions.&rdquo; The seven songs I hear are also rife with deep insecurity: Rodrigo brutally comparing herself with the new girlfriend, defeated by a boy&rsquo;s impossible standards, scrolling social media and feeling sick with envy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-139bh9t\">Obviously, beauty and success aren&rsquo;t everything, but it shows how absurdly poisonous social media is that the pretty, accomplished Rodrigo feels that way. &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s a lot of strength in saying: I don&rsquo;t know anything and I feel so insecure and unwanted,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If I were a younger person looking up to my favourite songwriter, I&rsquo;d be really moved by that so I hope I can provide that.&rdquo; Rodrigo is Filipino American, which created another point of comparison. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard for anyone to grow up in this media where it feels like if you don&rsquo;t have European features and blond hair and blue eyes, you&rsquo;re not traditionally pretty. I felt that a lot &ndash; since I don&rsquo;t look exactly like the girl next door in all these movies, I&rsquo;m not attractive. That actually took me a while to shake off. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m still shaking off now.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-139bh9t\">She has been online much less post-Drivers License. &ldquo;You can create your own reality sometimes with social media,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;What you see just becomes your reality, and it&rsquo;s totally not at all.&rdquo; On the cacophonous Jealousy, Jealousy, she sings, &ldquo;I think I think too much about kids who don&rsquo;t know me&rdquo;. To cope, now that she&rsquo;s more open to criticism than ever, she remembers her mum&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;Those who matter don&rsquo;t mind, and those who mind don&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-139bh9t\">Really, though, Rodrigo is her own worst critic. She started meeting labels about a solo deal in early 2020, after a song she had written for HSM, All I Want, went viral on TikTok and charted respectably. Then aged 17, she wasn&rsquo;t patronised by label executives, she says: the opposite. &ldquo;People tell you things they think you want to hear. I really appreciate honest opinions and people who won&rsquo;t compliment me in order to get what they want.&rdquo; She chose Interscope/Geffen because the CEO praised her songwriting, not her potential star quality. &ldquo;I want to be a songwriter,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be the biggest pop star that ever lived.&rdquo; (Inspired by Swift&rsquo;s fight to own her music, Rodrigo has retained control of her master recordings.)</p>\r\n<div class=\"ad-slot-container ad-slot--offset-right \">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"ad-slot-container ad-slot--offset-right \">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-139bh9t\">Rodrigo became wary of praise at Disney. &ldquo;From a younger age, I would get insecure because I felt like people weren&rsquo;t being honest with me. I started to have that voice in my head being like: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not good enough, don&rsquo;t listen to them&rsquo;, so I swung the opposite way of thinking everything I do is bad.&rdquo; Writing music alone made &ldquo;that pendulum reach equilibrium again&rdquo;. She made most of Sour with Daniel Nigro, the first producer she tried out with who told her a song wasn&rsquo;t good enough. (&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s a testament to really caring about the music and the artist.&rdquo;) She originally planned to release an EP called Sour, then decided it didn&rsquo;t showcase the extent of her abilities and told Geffen she wanted to make an album. &ldquo;They were like: &lsquo;All right girl, if you think you can do it&rsquo;,&rdquo; she says. So she worked 13-hour days, seven days a week to finish it.</p>\r\n<figure id=\"64f33946-7013-460d-ae0a-683d3f2ed3f4\" class=\" dcr-10khgmf\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.VideoYoutubeBlockElement\">\r\n<div class=\"dcr-ovv4bh\" data-component=\"youtube-embed\">\r\n<p class=\"dcr-139bh9t\">One side of Sour is about turning on yourself, Rodrigo says. &ldquo;As a younger child, I was confident almost to the point of being vain!&rdquo; (There&rsquo;s brilliant footage of her on YouTube as an eight-year-old singing M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e.) &ldquo;I remember turning 16, 17 and suddenly having all these doubts about myself and where I sit in the world and if people liked me. That felt like a distinct souring of that relationship.&rdquo; She is trying to remember that doing her best is enough. She started therapy partially because of the breakup, and has been working on prioritising herself instead of trying to fix someone else, a recurring lyrical theme. &ldquo;It has to come from you first: an empty pitcher can&rsquo;t pour.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-139bh9t\">Rodrigo&rsquo;s parents &ndash; Mum a teacher, Dad a family therapist &ndash; don&rsquo;t pressure her, she clarifies: they are proud, but they&rsquo;d be proud whatever. They lived in Temecula, California. She pushed to attend auditions. An only child, she calls her parents her &ldquo;BFFs&rdquo; and has never rebelled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been a real goody two-shoes. My music can be my form of teenage rebellion. There&rsquo;s songs that are so angsty and intense.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-139bh9t\">Some Disney stars revolt as soon as they&rsquo;re out the door; others come to terms with how it affected them years later. Does she feel looked after by them? &ldquo;Oh, ho ho ho, these are hot topics,&rdquo; Rodrigo says playfully, then pauses. She skirts the question, worried that she might &ldquo;get my foot in my mouth&rdquo; and upset people. She is committed to HSM for two more years, which will make for a challenging parallel career. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me,&rdquo; she says. She wants to focus on music. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s really hard to split time between the two and there are very few artists who do that efficiently, because acting is based on being a good liar and presenting a version of yourself that&rsquo;s believable, and being a songwriter is the complete opposite. It&rsquo;s like, here are all of my deepest, darkest secrets and I want you to know me so personally.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-139bh9t\">Rodrigo is not sad to leave this part of her life behind. &ldquo;Resounding no!&rdquo; she says. Nostalgia isn&rsquo;t her style. &ldquo;I always wanted to grow up because I feel you get better with age and figure out who you are. I feel like I get happier as I get older.&rdquo; She cannot wait to write it into albums, too. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of my favourite parts about songwriters like Taylor Swift, because you get to grow up with them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-139bh9t\">Rodrigo recently had what she calls a &ldquo;crash course in adulthood&rdquo;, turning 18, having the biggest song in the world, finishing her album and moving into her own place within a few weeks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a soft move out &ndash; my parents are there a lot of the time,&rdquo; she says, with a kindly eye roll. &ldquo;But I love being alone. And I love my own solitude.&rdquo; As she stares down a year that will undoubtedly leave her on first-name terms with the public, you sense it will become a precious commodity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-139bh9t\"><em>Olivia Rodrigo&rsquo;s debut album, Sour, is out on 21 May on Universal.</em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</figure>', '9532560.webp', 1, 'Music', '2022-06-30'),
(47, 'Explosion of life on Earth linked to heavy metal act at planet’s centre', '<p class=\"dcr-xry7m2\">At the centre of the Earth, a giant sphere of solid iron is slowly swelling. This is the inner core and scientists have recently uncovered intriguing evidence that suggests its birth half a billion years ago may have played a key role in the evolution of life on Earth.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-xry7m2\">At that time, our planet&rsquo;s magnetic field was faltering &ndash; and that would have had critical consequences, they argue. Normally this field protects life on the surface by repelling cosmic radiation and charged particles emitted by our sun.</p>\r\n<div id=\"sign-in-gate\"></div>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-xry7m2\">But 550m years ago, it had dropped to a fraction of its current strength &ndash; before it abruptly regained its power. And in the wake of this planetary reboot, Earth witnessed the sudden proliferation of complex multicellular life on its surface. This was the Cambrian explosion, when most major animal groups first appeared in the fossil record. Now scientists have linked it to events at the very centre of the Earth.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-xry7m2\">Our planet consists of spheres. There is a 5-70km-thick layer of rock that covers Earth like an eggshell. This is called the crust and below it lies the mantle, made up of a 3,000km layer of silicates. Further down, there is the outer core, made of molten iron, and inside it there is another sphere &ndash; of solid iron. It is more than 2,000km in diameter and is growing by about a millimetre a year.</p>\r\n<div class=\"ad-slot-container ad-slot--offset-right \">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"ad-slot-container ad-slot--offset-right \">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-xry7m2\">&ldquo;Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field is generated by swirling iron in the outer core,&rdquo; said John Tarduno, professor of geophysics at the University of Rochester, New York. &ldquo;Before the Cambrian explosion the core was entirely molten and its ability to generate a magnetic field was collapsing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-xry7m2\">Analysis of crystals in rocks in Quebec by Tarduno&rsquo;s team has shown that Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field was less than 10% of its current strength and would have provided poor protection against cosmic and solar radiation. The dynamo that drives Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field was probably losing power because of rapid heat loss from the core, it is argued.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-xry7m2\">Then the core began to solidify at its centre, which had profound consequences. Essentially it turbocharged motions in the outer core, restoring the strength to the planet&rsquo;s magnetic field. &ldquo;Our research indicates that the formation of the inner core began approximately 550m years ago and that happened just before the Cambrian explosion occurred,&rdquo; said Tarduno.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-xry7m2\">Why and how the inner core was born had been a mystery. From its tiny beginning half a billion years ago it has grown to a moon-sized sphere of solid iron. It is the most metallic place on Earth and it has had a major impact on conditions on the surface.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-xry7m2\">Most importantly, it provided our world with a magnetic field. Observations of other worlds &ndash; where these fields have disappeared &ndash; reveal the dramatic consequences of this loss. An example is provided by Mars, which lost its magnetic field 4bn years ago. Without protection from the solar wind &ndash; the continual stream of protons and electrons that pour out from the surface of the sun &ndash; the Martian atmosphere was driven off into space, leaving its surface dead and waterless.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-xry7m2\">&ldquo;Earth would not have evolved like Mars but it certainly would have lost more water than it has today if it had not rebooted its magnetic field,&rdquo; added Tarduno. &ldquo;It would certainly have been a very much drier planet that the one we live in today.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"dcr-xry7m2\">However, the geophysicist was reluctant to speculate exactly how the rebirth of Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field would have influenced the evolution of life. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that the return of Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field and the subsequent explosion of life on Earth can be unconnected. But we cannot say what was the exact pattern of events as yet. That needs more study.&rdquo;</p>', '4225000.webp', 1, 'Science', '2022-06-30'),
(48, 'Tesla Sales Slow as the Pandemic Hobbles Production', '<p>Tesla said Saturday that vehicle deliveries from April through June fell 18 percent from the first quarter of the year, a rare slowdown for the company caused by production problems in China.</p>\r\n<p>Tesla sells more electric cars than any other company and, until recently, was expanding rapidly in China, Europe and the United States as the rising price of gasoline increased the appeal of battery power. The company continues to withstand supply chain turmoil better than rivals like General Motors and Toyota, both of which reported steep declines in sales on Friday.</p>\r\n<p>There is plenty of demand for cars, especially electric cars, but shortages of semiconductors and other key components are forcing buyers to wait many months for deliveries.</p>\r\n<p>Tesla delivered more than 254,000 vehicles in the quarter compared with 310,000 in the first quarter. It was the first quarterly decline in deliveries since the beginning of 2020, when the onset of the pandemic undercut car sales worldwide.</p>\r\n<p>Tesla suggested Saturday that deliveries could rebound in coming months as it overcomes supply chain problems, saying that it built more cars in June than ever in its history.</p>\r\n<p>Shutdowns and shortages of components related to the pandemic hobbled operations at the company&rsquo;s factory in Shanghai. China has the world&rsquo;s largest car market and accounts for about 40 percent of Tesla sales.</p>\r\n<p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Production in China was &ldquo;an absolute disaster in the months of April and May,&rdquo; Daniel Ives and John Katsingris, analysts at Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors this past week.</p>\r\n<p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Despite the slowdown in deliveries, Tesla is still faring better than other automakers. Compared with the first quarter of 2021, Tesla deliveries rose 26 percent. That is much better than General Motors, which said Friday that its U.S. deliveries of new vehicles in the second quarter declined 15 percent from a year earlier. Similarly, Toyota Motor reported a drop of 23 percent in U.S. sales.</p>\r\n<p>Tesla has more orders than it can fill, but demand could slow if the global economy hits a speed bump. Elon Musk, Tesla&rsquo;s chief executive, warned in an interview with Bloomberg News in June that a recession was &ldquo;inevitable at some point&rdquo; and that &ldquo;more likely than not&rdquo; it would come soon. He has told staff that the company will cut 10 percent of its salaried work force.</p>\r\n<p>Tesla appears unlikely to match its growth from last year, when deliveries rose 90 percent to 940,000 cars. A 50 percent increase for 2022 is more realistic, the Wedbush analysts said.</p>\r\n<p>That, they said in a note on Saturday, is still &ldquo;an impressive feat&rdquo; considering that China was &ldquo;essentially shut down for two months.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The slower growth rate is one factor that has caused investors to reassess Tesla&rsquo;s chances of dominating the car business. Tesla shares have fallen more than 40 percent from their peak in November, even as more and more buyers choose electric cars because of their superior energy efficiency.</p>\r\n<p>Depending on local utility rates, an electric car costs significantly less to operate than a fossil-fuel vehicle. A Tesla Model 3 standard range gets the equivalent of 142 miles to the gallon and costs $450 per year to fuel, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. By comparison, a Honda Accord with a gasoline engine gets 33 miles to the gallon and costs $2,200 per year to fuel.</p>', '02tesla-sales-1-superJumbo.jpg', 1, 'Technology', '2022-07-03'),
(49, ' Dashboard of decline: seven charts that explain Britain’s economic crisis', '<p>The UK is sliding towards a recession. Only six months ago, a strong recovery was expected, but the impact of the pandemic, the slow return to pre-Covid work patterns and soaring inflation driven by the Ukraine invasion have depressed the economy.</p>\r\n<p>Last week the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, warned that Britons are likely to suffer a deeper and longer downturn than other major industrialised nations. He also said inflation would be more severe and persistent.</p>\r\n<p>Unique to the British experience is Brexit, which has imposed extra costs and restrictions on exporters to the EU and limited the supply of skilled labour. And after 10 years of austerity, publicly funded organisations entered the pandemic in a weak position and are now in an even worse state as they grapple with the rocketing cost of living and a shortage of workers.</p>\r\n<p>Millions of people in the top two-thirds of the earnings ladder saved money during the pandemic &ndash; because opportunities for spending on travel, eating out and shopping were severely curtailed. With about &pound;260bn in bank deposit accounts, it was reasonable to expect the recovery to see an explosion of demand.</p>\r\n<p>When restrictions eased, employers put out a call for workers to meet that increased demand in restaurants, shops and more. However, many self-employed and older people who stopped working during the pandemic have stayed on the sidelines &ndash; unwilling to apply for jobs, or unable to because of illness.</p>\r\n<p>The latest jobs figures, for the three months to April, show vacancies hitting a fresh high of 1.3m, and unemployment at a 40-year low.</p>\r\n<p>According to the Institute for Employment Studies (IES), there are now about a million fewer people in the labour force than before the pandemic. Three-quarters of this can be explained by older people and those with long-term health conditions quitting the jobs market; the rest can be blamed on the lack of EU workers post-Brexit.</p>\r\n<p>Pay levels are not helping draw people back to the workplace. When adjusted for inflation, pay fell by 4.5% in the year to April, the biggest fall since comparable records began in 2001. Tony Wilson, head of the IES, says: &ldquo;The labour market continues to see a toxic combination of falling real-terms pay, high worklessness and labour shortages.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile the government has switched off its pandemic-related apprenticeship schemes, leaving only the much-maligned apprenticeship levy, which many employers say is bureaucratic and costly.</p>', '4158.webp', 1, 'Business', '2022-07-03'),
(50, 'Music for general societal exhaustion: that’s why Ed Sheeran sells so much', '<p>Last September Ed Sheeran&rsquo;s Bad Habits was finally dislodged from its seat at No 1 in the UK singles chart after 11 long weeks. Its replacement? Ed Sheeran&rsquo;s Shivers, which subsequently nestled at the top for a month. That&rsquo;s nearly a quarter of 2021&rsquo;s singles charts ruled by one man. The streaming stats for both songs are mind-boggling, with combined Spotify plays at the time of writing soaring past 2bn, while their parent album, = (Equals), hasn&rsquo;t left the UK top 5 in eight months.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s hardly surprising, then, that this week the music licensing body, PPL, announced Ed Sheeran as the most-played artist in the UK in 2021. In fact, it&rsquo;s an honour he&rsquo;s achieved in four out of the last five years. Not only that, but Bad Habits was 2021&rsquo;s most-played song, beating hits from the likes of The Weeknd (whose Blinding Lights banger Bad Habits cribs from), Little Mix and Coldplay. People, it seems, can&rsquo;t get enough &ndash; but what makes Sheeran&rsquo;s success so enduring?</p>\r\n<p>The roots of Sheeran&rsquo;s ubiquity can be traced back to his mainstream arrival a decade ago. His success chimed with the rise of what journalist Peter Robinson called the New Boring, a prevailing anti-fun agenda that&rsquo;s since become deep-rooted. Set in opposition to the untouchable, deity-like superstars such as Beyonc&eacute; (who would later collaborate with Sheeran on UK Christmas No 1, Perfect), and the avant-garde meat dress-sporting likes of Lady Gaga, artists such as Sheeran, Adele and Emeli Sand&eacute; made open, emotionally straightforward, resolutely &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; music broad enough to leave no one feeling alienated.</p>\r\n<p>Sheeran prized relatability from the start &ndash; shuffling awkwardly into glitzy award shows in a hoodie. Rather than shroud his music-making in layers of mystery, or bejewel it with highfalutin concepts, Sheeran revelled in its laser-focused box-ticking. So third album &divide; (Divide)&rsquo;s two lead singles, Castle on a Hill and Shape of You, were crafted to simultaneously hit two different demographics: the former&rsquo;s drive-time rock was perfect for Radio 2, while the latter&rsquo;s tropical-tinged R&amp;B (the song was initially offered to Rihanna) was aimed at Radio 1. It quickly established him as a master of both worlds.</p>\r\n<p>The cynicism of the songs&rsquo; creation was, of course, irrelevant to the listener. And therein lies the crux of Sheeran&rsquo;s success. As an artist he rarely impedes the songs he creates. His world is frictionless. He can skip between genres with ease, be it indie-folk, pop, R&amp;B, grime, hip-hop, because each new persona is a projection on to a blank slate. His personality rarely gets in the way of the music; his social media presence is a promotional tool rather than a distraction.</p>\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s also malleable &ndash; when he&rsquo;s done with hip-hop, for example, he doesn&rsquo;t need an image overhaul to then revert to balladry. If one genre isn&rsquo;t to your tastes, then fear not, another will be along soon. It&rsquo;s Now That&rsquo;s What I Call Basic. Thanks to his penchant for far-reaching, streaming-ready collaborations, from Stormzy to Beyonc&eacute; to Bring Me The Horizon, he can also inhale the whiff of second-hand cool even if the concept remains alien to him. He can often look like a competition winner stood next to his favourite singer, which in turn helps him keep that unthreatening, everyman status intact. His authentic singer-songwriter status means he&rsquo;s a credible pop artist to pal up with, while his early appearances on rap channel SB:TV, and his genuine championing of pre-mainstream fame Stormzy, mean accusations of appropriation rarely stick (although his recent move into drill certainly raised eyebrows).</p>\r\n<p>In a complicated world, Sheeran&rsquo;s musical modus operandi is straightforward; to create well-crafted, expertly vague songs that unite people. Politics is verboten in Sheeran&rsquo;s bubble, which for some must make him a breath of fresh air in a pop world occasionally weighed down by discourse. His songs are vessels broad enough to soundtrack both a first dance and a funeral procession, a gut-punch break-up and a trawl around a harshly lit shopping centre. They&rsquo;re for life&rsquo;s big moments, with all the cinematic edge of a Richard Curtis film.</p>\r\n<p>At a time of general societal exhaustion, burnout and fatigue, Ed Sheeran kindly doesn&rsquo;t ask the listener to put in any work. His music, always just at the endpoint of the pop zeitgeist, does all the heavy lifting for you, while crumbling under closer inspection. It&rsquo;s not just aural wallpaper that fades completely into the background, but more the musical equivalent of a Live Laugh Love sign; well-meaning, vaguely uplifting but as deep as a puddle. Sometimes boring is what we deserve.</p>', '162Screenshot 2022-07-03 231204.jpg', 1, 'Music', '2022-07-03'),
(51, ' Doctor Strange review – sharp wit and spiritual popcorn', '<p>Visually distinctive, classily cast and mostly coherent, this latest picture from the Marvel stable is that rarest of beasts, a comic-book movie that fully justifies its reliance on CGI effects. This superior hero-origin story nods to the spatial origami of Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s Inception and has something of the baroque enchantment of the Harry Potter series. It&rsquo;s also, at times, the most brain-meltingly effective piece of psychedelic cinema since Peter Fonda got himself comprehensively wigged out in The Trip.</p>\r\n<p>But crucially, Doctor Strange is very much its own entity: a handsome, endlessly fascinating conundrum of Escher-like complexity. Director Scott Derrickson, who also co-wrote the film, effortlessly negotiates the leap from quality horror pictures (The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Sinister) to this daringly spiritual popcorn movie. There&rsquo;s a sharp wit to the screenplay, which credits the audience with enough smarts to catch the punchline to a joke that was set up a full hour before. But Derrickson&rsquo;s greatest achievement is incorporating so much cosmic guff into the story &ndash; astral planes, third eyes and mandalas abound &ndash; without ever seeming like a stoner&rsquo;s motivational bedroom poster.</p>\r\n<p>Much of the success of the film is down to the casting. As Dr Stephen Strange, the brilliant neurosurgeon whose career is wrecked by a devastating car accident, Benedict Cumberbatch is as steely and sharp as the surgical implements he uses to probe the damaged brains of his patients. When we meet him, he has something of the privileged swagger of Tony Stark (Iron Man) but none of his warmth. But Cumberbatch makes the least immediately likable of the Marvel heroes into the most unpredictable and intriguing. Strange&rsquo;s desperation over his ruined hands takes him to Nepal and to the secretive enclave headed by a guru known only as the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton).</p>\r\n<p>Swinton is typically excellent as Strange&rsquo;s mentor in the arts of magic. An unworldly Zen teacher with a touch of very earthly cruelty, there&rsquo;s authority to her screen presence that gives weight to Strange&rsquo;s spiritual journey. Strong support from Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo and Benedict Wong as Wong brings heart and wry humour to the story. Meanwhile, Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen is somewhat underused as Kaecilius, a renegade former disciple. With his purple eyeshadow and back-up team of zealots, he looks like the frontman to a glam-rock covers band.Unexpectedly, one of the strongest characters turns out to be an item of clothing. Doctor Strange&rsquo;s trademark cloak has deft comic timing and a scene-stealing knack for a sight gag.</p>\r\n<p>The solidity of the performances is a necessary anchor as we plunge into the mind-bending layers of trippy visuals (not for nothing does Stan Lee make a cameo as a bus passenger chuckling over a copy of Aldous Huxley&rsquo;s Doors of Perception). This is one instance where audiences watching in 2D rather than 3D will be missing out significantly. Not only does the fantasy element pop out of the screen, the teeming chaos of Nepal looks astonishing.</p>\r\n<p>Two end-credit stings give a hint of things to come on our next appointment with the Doctor, suggesting that Marvel fully appreciates the invigorating transfusion of new blood that this film provides.</p>', '1887.webp', 1, 'Movie', '2022-07-03');
